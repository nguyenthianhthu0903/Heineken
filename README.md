** SOLUTION
Count the number of people in the images.
Determine how many of them are drinking Heineken beers.
Find and list items with Heinekenâ€™s brand logos.
Name the exact items (e.g., bucket, bottle, can, fridge, signage, billboard, tent card, display stand, tabletop, parasol).
Analyze the mood and tone of the images (emotional detection).
Identify promotion girls/boys in the images.
Verify if there are at least 2 promotion girls at each dining place/restaurant.
Ensure Heineken display concepts are correctly deployed at grocery stores/outlets: 1 billboard/ 1 standee/ 10 kegs of beers.
